LILLVIKEN water trap and strainer are included in the price, but packaged separately. Water trap with connection for dishwasher or washing machine. Fits cabinet frames min. 40 cm wide. Can be under-glued. May be completed with GRUNDVATTNET sink accessories for effective use of space on the sink. May be completed with LILLVIKEN lid. This product bears the CE mark. When stainless steel is new, it is natural that the first scratches are visible. They become less visible over time as the material is used and gets a more matte tone.

Cotton velvet feels nice and soft against your skin and gives the surface an extra lustre. Cotton velvet gives depth to the colour and softness to the touch. Velvet is a soft, luxurious fabric that is resistant to abrasion and easy to clean using the soft brush attachment on your vacuum. Individually wrapped pocket springs, in the mattress core, work independently and closely follow your body; giving you support in all the right places. A layer of memory foam in the mattress moulds to the contours of your body, relieves pressure and helps you to relax. The velvet reflects light in a characteristic way which may make the colour appear as if it changes. Press marks that may appear on the velvet usually disappear after some time. With your hand, you can gently stroke in the direction of the pile or use a clothes brush. You can also use the vacuum cleaner with the soft nozzle. Small fibres may appear on velvet. It happens naturally and they disappear over time and can also be removed with a garment roll. To make sure that velvet maintains its look and feel, it needs to be cared for regularly according to the care instructions included with the product. The mattress and mattress base covers are removable and washable. The cover on the headboard is fixed. All parts are included in the price but packaged separately. Bed linen sold separately.

The lightweight frames are easy to lift and move. The compact design is perfect for tight spaces or under low ceilings, so you can make the most of your available space. The stacked beds stand steady since the upper bed has small plastic feet which fit into holes on the lower bed.

With glazing paint, oil or paint, you can easily make the surface more durable – and your furniture more personal. Can be used with up to 13 cm thick mattresses. Stack max. 2 beds on top of each other. 2 straps with press studs prevent the beds from sliding apart when they are next to each other.

The stainless steel shelf has a durable surface which is easy to keep clean. The built-in thermometer on the hood helps you check the temperature during grilling – without having to lift the hood. To get the desired grill temperature you can regulate the air flow by adjusting the stainless steel vent on the hood and on the front of the barbeque. The cooking grate is durable and rustproof, as it is made of high-grade stainless steel. The ash tray can be pulled out, so it’s easy to empty the ashes once you have finished grilling. For outdoor use only. Read the included manual carefully before you start to use the barbecue. Do not use a knife or other sharp objects directly on the shelf surface. Always use a chopping board. Cooking area: 50x38 cm. Castors included. May be completed with TOSTERÖ cover for barbecue. Use VÅRDA wood stain, outdoor use when re-staining the furniture, sold separately.

The powder-coated steel frame is strong, sturdy and easy to maintain. You can sit up comfortably in bed thanks to the high headboard – just prop some pillows behind your back and you will have a comfortable place to read or watch TV. There’s plenty of space under the bed for storage boxes – great for stowing extra quilts and sheets. You can choose the mattress comfort that’s best for you – the high headboard and footboard work well with mattresses of different thicknesses. The high footboard keeps bed textiles from falling onto the floor while you sleep. Whether you prefer bold or romantic, this versatile bed frame will look great with your choice of textiles and bedroom furniture. 17 layer-glued slats adjust to your body weight and increase the suppleness of the mattress. The price for this combination includes SKORVA midbeam, but it is a separate product which you pick from its own shelf at the store. If you buy the bed via the website, SKORVA midbeam is included in the delivery. Mattress and bedlinen are sold separately.

For added durability and so you can enjoy the natural expression of the wood, the furniture has been pre-treated with several layers of semi-transparent wood stain. The frame is made of rustproof aluminium which makes it sturdy, lightweight and maintenance free. The eucalyptus slats have grain variations and natural colour shifts that give the furniture a warm and natural look. Only recommended for outdoor use.

Made of wood from sustainable sources. You can choose to use one unit or combine several to create a larger storage solution if your needs change. Glass doors keep your finest items free from dust but still visible. The height of the furniture allows the top to be used as a display surface, so you can show even more of your favourite things. The shelves in tempered glass with wooden edges are durable and give the furniture a slim, light and airy look. The doors close quietly and softly thanks to the integrated soft-closing function. The surface is durable and easy to keep clean. Scandinavian design with clean simple lines makes it easy to combine the cabinet with furniture in different styles. Tempered glass is more impact resistant than ordinary glass. Solid wood is natural, renewable and separable material. Matches other furniture in the HAVSTA series. This furniture must be fixed to the wall with the enclosed wall fastener. Different wall materials require different types of fixing devices. Use fixing devices suitable for the walls in your home, sold separately. Handle with care! A damaged edge or scratched surface can cause the glass to suddenly crack and/or break. Avoid collisions from the side - this is where the glass is most vulnerable. Knobs and hinges included. Two persons are needed for the assembly of this furniture.

Soft, movable back cushions allow you to find a way to sit that feels relaxed and suits you. The sofa's sections can be combined in different ways to get a size and shape that suits you. If you ever need a larger sofa, you can always add a section or two. The fixed KIMSTAD coated fabric cover is a soft yet durable fabric made of polyester and cotton. The protective polyurethane coating means that it’s easy to keep clean and that it both feels and looks like leather. The cover is easy to keep clean as it can be wiped clean with a damp cloth. The sofa is quickly and easily transformed into a spacious bed by removing the seat and back cushions and pulling out the underframe. You can use the sofa's back cushions to get a comfortable back support to lean against in the bed. The sofa-bed has a 12 cm thick bed mattress in high resilience foam that provides comfortable support to your body and a smooth sleeping surface without disturbing joints. The bed slats work together with the mattress to give a more flexible comfort and nice sleep support. The mattress is easy to keep clean since you can remove the mattress cover and machine wash it. 10 year guarantee. Read about the terms in the guarantee brochure. 4 back cushions are included.

To get the desired grill temperature you can regulate the air flow by adjusting the stainless steel vent on the hood and on the front of the barbeque. The cooking grate is durable and rustproof, as it is made of high-grade stainless steel. The ash tray can be pulled out, so it’s easy to empty the ashes once you have finished grilling. For outdoor use only. Read the included manual carefully before you start to use the barbecue. Do not place hot objects directly on the wooden top shelf. Always use a pot stand to protect the shelf surface. Do not use a knife or other sharp objects directly on the shelf surface. Always use a chopping board. Castors included.

If you want to organise inside you can complement with interior organisers from the KOMPLEMENT series. Adjustable feet make it possible to compensate any irregularities in the floor. With the PAX Planner, you can easily complete your combination with integrated lighting. After choosing the light source, the planner will work out which accessories you need to complete the solution. Min. ceiling height required: 240 cm. Two persons are needed for the assembly of this furniture. Interior accessories  that help you organise inside your wardrobe are sold separately. This furniture must be fixed to the wall with the enclosed wall fastener. Different wall materials require different types of fixing devices.
